# ALiCE Web SDK: React demo app

This a very basic example of integration using React

## Requirements

This demo uses a sandbox token based authentication so you will need to provide your sandbox token as the REACT_APP_SANDBOX_TOKEN environment variable (usually done through a `.env.local` file)

## Running the demo

In the project directory, run:

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser to test the demo.
